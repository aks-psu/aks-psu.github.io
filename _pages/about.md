Hi, thanks for stopping by,

I am a PhD student working in [Grauer Lab](http://samgrauer.ca/) at [Penn State](https://www.me.psu.edu/). I'm working to improve fluid mechanics and combustion diagnostic techniques through advanced Computational Imaging and tomography framework. My research focuses on solving complex flow reconstruction problems by leveraging realistic imaging models and machine learning techniques. Specializing in inverse problems, I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, NIRF, and physics-informed machine learning. By integrating physical laws with data-driven methods, my work aims to push the boundaries of imaging and flow analysis, contributing to more accurate diagnostics and innovative solutions in experimental measurements. Specifically, I am working on Chemiluminesce Tomography but working on expanding my knowledge in Background Oriented Schlieren Tomography and PIV. 

Previously, I have worked on Rarefied Flow at [Non-equilibrium Flow Simulation (NFS) Laboratory](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~rkm/) as part of my master's thesis and hold bachelor and master degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). I have also worked on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and have exposure working in experimental facilities on High-speed flows and combustion.   

In my spare time, I prefer watching movies and reading books related to various cultures and Indian politics. I grew up in the northern part of India and am fluent in Hindi.
