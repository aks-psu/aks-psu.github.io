Hi, thanks for stopping by! üëè,

I am a PhD student working in [Grauer Lab](http://samgrauer.ca/) at [Penn State](https://www.me.psu.edu/). I am interested in improving fluid mechanics and combustion diagnostic techniques through advanced Computational Imaging and tomography framework. My current research focuses on solving complex flow reconstruction problems by leveraging realistic imaging models and machine learning techniques. Specializing in inverse problems, I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, NIRF, and physics-informed machine learning. By integrating physical laws with data-driven methods, my work aims to push the boundaries of imaging and flow analysis, contributing to more accurate diagnostics and innovative solutions in experimental measurements. Specifically, I am working on Chemiluminesce Tomography but making an effort towards expanding my knowledge in the Background Oriented Schlieren Tomography and PIV. 

Previously, I have worked on Rarefied Flow at [Non-equilibrium Flow Simulation (NFS) Laboratory](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~rkm/) as part of my master's thesis and Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degree in Aerospace Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). I have also worked on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and have exposure working in experimental facilities on High-speed flows and combustion.   

In my spare time, I prefer watching movies and reading books related to cultures, religion, and Indian politics. I grew up in the northern part of India and can fluently speak Hindi.
