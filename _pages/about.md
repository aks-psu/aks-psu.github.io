As a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering, I'm working on improving diagnostic techniques in fluid mechanics and combustion through advanced Computational Imaging and tomography. My research focuses on solving complex flow reconstruction problems by leveraging realistic imaging models and machine learning techniques. Specializing in inverse problems, I work at the intersection of fluid mechanics and machine learning, particularly in computer vision, NIRF, and physics-informed machine learning. By integrating physical laws with data-driven methods, my work aims to push the boundaries of imaging and flow analysis, contributing to more accurate diagnostics and innovative solutions in experimental measurements.
